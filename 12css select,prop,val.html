    <p>In this program i have introduced font size</p>
    <p>HTML has tags, CSS has selectors. Selectors are the names given to styles in internal and external style sheets.</p>
    <p>px (such as font-size: 12px) is the unit for pixels.</p>
    <p>em (such as font-size: 2em) is the unit for the calculated size of a font. So “2em”, for example, is two times the current font size.</p>
    <p>pt (such as font-size: 12pt) is the unit for points, for measurements typically in printed media.</p>
      <p>% (such as width: 80%) is the unit for… wait for it… percentages.</p>
